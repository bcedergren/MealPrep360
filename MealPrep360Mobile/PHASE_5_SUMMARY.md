- **CookingPreferences**: Skill level, preferred methods, time constraints, budget
- **HealthGoals**: Primary/secondary goals, target weight, fitness level, medical conditions
- **KitchenEquipment**: Appliances, cookware, tools, storage capacity
- **NotificationSettings**: 15+ notification types with granular control
- **AppSettings**: Theme, language, units, privacy, data sync, accessibility

**Advanced Features:**
- **BMR/TDEE Calculations**: Automatic calorie target calculation based on user stats
- **Macro Target Validation**: Ensures macro percentages add up to 100%

### 2. User Profile Management Hook (`src/hooks/useUserProfile.ts`)

**Complete State Management:**
```typescript
// Profile state
profile: UserProfile | null;
isLoading: boolean;
isSaving: boolean;
error: string | null;

// Profile management
createProfile: (profileData: Partial<UserProfile>) => Promise<void>;
updateProfile: (updates: Partial<UserProfile>) => Promise<void>;
deleteProfile: () => Promise<void>;
