## 🏗️ Architecture Achievement

### Before (TypeScript Only)
```
Frontend → API Gateway → Services → MongoDB
                ↓
           Direct OpenAI calls
           Manual aggregations
           Limited image processing
```

### After (Hybrid TypeScript + Python)
```
Frontend → API Gateway → TypeScript Services → MongoDB
                ↓              ↓
                └──→ Python Microservices ←──┘
                     ├── AI (OpenAI)
                     ├── Analytics (Pandas)
                     ├── Image (Pillow)
                     ├── Worker (Celery)
                     ├── Nutrition (USDA)
                     ├── ML (scikit-learn)
                     └── Report (ReportLab)
```

**Result:** Best of both worlds - TypeScript for business logic, Python for specialized tasks
