# Recipe Field Comparison

## What TypeScript Currently Returns vs What Python AI Service Returns

### TypeScript MealPrep360Service (Current Working Implementation)
```typescript
interface MealPrep360Recipe {
  title: string
  description: string
  ingredients: Array<{ name, amount, unit }>
  prepInstructions: string[]
  prepTime: number
  cookTime: number
  servings: number
  tags: string[]
  storageTime: number
  containerSuggestions: string[]
  defrostInstructions: string[]
  cookingInstructions: string[]
  servingInstructions: string[]
  allergenInfo: string[]
  dietaryInfo: string[]
  season: string
}
```
**Total: 16 fields**

### Python AI Service (Current Schema)
```python
class Recipe(BaseModel):
  # Core (3 fields)
  title: str
  description: str
  summary: str  ← ADDED
  
  # Ingredients & Instructions (5 fields)
  ingredients: List[Ingredient]
  instructions: List[str]  ← ADDED

  }
}
```
**Total: 24 fields + 7 nutrition sub-fields = 31 data points!**

### What's EXTRA in Python (Not in TypeScript)
- ✅ `summary` - For preview cards
- ✅ `instructions` - General cooking instructions
- ✅ `freezerPrep` - Dedicated freezer prep steps
- ✅ `category` - Recipe category classification
- ✅ `cuisine` - Cuisine type
- ✅ `difficulty` - Easy/medium/hard
- ✅ `mealType` - Breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks
- ✅ `nutrition` - Complete nutrition facts (7 fields)

### What's Missing from Python (That TypeScript Has)
**NONE!** Python has everything TypeScript has, PLUS more!

## Tell Me: What Specific Fields Are You Not Seeing?

Please let me know which fields you need that aren't showing up. For example:
- Recipe images?
- Specific instruction formats?
- Different data structure?
- Database IDs?
- User-specific fields?

I'll update the schema to match exactly what you need!
