# MealPrep360 Communication Fixes Applied âœ…

## Issue Summary
The frontend web app was getting 401 Unauthorized errors when calling shopping lists API because:
1. Next.js redirects were sending calls to external API without proper authentication
2. The external API calls were bypassing the internal authentication handling

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Removed Next.js Redirects and Rewrites**
**File:** `MealPrep360/next.config.js`
- âœ… Removed redirect for `/api/shopping-lists` â†’ external API
- âœ… Removed rewrite for `/api/shopping-lists/:path*` â†’ external API
- âœ… Now uses internal API routes that handle authentication properly

**Before:**
```javascript
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/api/shopping-lists',
      destination: 'https://api.mealprep360.com/api/shopping-lists',
      permanent: false,
    },
  ];
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
async redirects() {
  return [
    // No redirects needed - use internal APIs
  ];
}
```

### 2. **Communication Flow Now Fixed**
```
Frontend Call: /api/shopping-lists
â†“ (No redirect/rewrite)
Internal API: /src/app/api/shopping-lists/route.ts
â†“ (With authentication)
External API Gateway: https://api.mealprep360.com/api/shopping-lists
â†“
Shopping Service: https://shopping.mealprep360.com
```

## Required Action to Complete Fix

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Restart the Next.js Development Server**

After changing `next.config.js`, you must restart the development server for the changes to take effect:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd MealPrep360
npm run dev
```

## Expected Result After Restart

âœ… **Before:** `GET https://api.mealprep360.com/api/shopping-lists` (401 Unauthorized)
âœ… **After:** `GET http://localhost:3000/api/shopping-lists` (200 OK with authentication)

## Additional Fixes Made

### Mobile App API Configuration
- âœ… Removed `/v1` versioning issue
- âœ… Fixed all endpoint paths to use `/api/` prefix
- âœ… Updated non-existent endpoints to use working alternatives

### Admin Dashboard Configuration  
- âœ… Fixed default API base URL configuration
- âœ… Updated environment variable examples

### Environment Variables
- âœ… Fixed Mobile App `.env.example` Git merge conflict
- âœ… Added proper API URL configurations for all projects

## Test Verification

After restarting the server, test these endpoints:
1. Shopping Lists: Should load without 401 errors
2. Meal Plans: Should work correctly  
3. Recipes: Should load properly
4. User Authentication: Should work across all features

The communication architecture is now properly aligned with internal authentication handling!
