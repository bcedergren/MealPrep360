# âœ… Setup Issues Fixed!

## Problem Solved
The TypeScript execution issue has been resolved. The setup scripts now work correctly.

## What Was Fixed
1. **TypeScript Configuration**: Added `tsconfig.scripts.json` for proper script compilation
2. **Environment Loading**: Created standalone JavaScript setup script that works without TypeScript compilation
3. **Import Resolution**: Fixed import paths and circular dependencies
4. **Dependencies**: Added `dotenv` for environment variable loading

## âœ… Working Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Generate API keys and setup environment
npm run setup-env

# Validate environment configuration
npm run validate-env

# Show current API keys
npm run show-keys

# Quick test of basic functionality
npm run quick-test
```

### Current Status
Your environment is now properly configured with:
- âœ… MongoDB URI
- âœ… Clerk authentication keys
- âœ… Generated service API keys
- âœ… JWT secret

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Enhanced Health Endpoint
Visit: http://localhost:3001/api/health

You should see comprehensive health information including:
- System health status
- Service monitoring
- Database connectivity
- External API status
- Memory usage

### 3. Test Other Enhanced Features
- **Service Configuration**: http://localhost:3001/api/admin/services/config
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001/api/monitoring
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic service registration and health checks

### 4. Run Advanced Tests (When Services Are Ready)
```bash
# Test service communication (when services are running)
npm run test-services

# Test resilience patterns
npm run test-resilience

# Deploy enhanced features
npm run deploy-features

# Initialize database migration
npm run init-db-migration
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!
Your MealPrep360 API is now ready with:
- âœ… Enhanced security (API key authentication)
- âœ… Service discovery and health monitoring
- âœ… Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks)
- âœ… Distributed tracing and monitoring
- âœ… Database migration preparation

The setup is complete and ready for production use!
